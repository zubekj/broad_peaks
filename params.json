For example, expanded \r\nregions of DNA sequences that are \r\nmarked by enhancer-specific histone modifications, \r\nsuch as acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) domains coincide with cell-specific enhancers, known as super or \r\nstretch enhancers. Similarly, promoters of genes critical for cell-specific functions are \r\nmarked by expanded H3K4me3 domains in the cognate cell type, and these can span \r\nDNA regions from 4-5kb up to 40-50kb in length. These expanded H3K4me3 domains \r\nare known as buffer domains or super promoters. To ask what correlates with—and \r\npotentially regulates—the length of deposition patterns for these two important histone \r\nmarks,  we  built  Random  Forest  regression  models and computationally  identified \r\ngenomic and epigenomic patterns in multiple ENCODE cell lines and human pancreatic \r\nislets.  We  found  that  certain  epigenetic  marks  and \r\ntranscription  factors,  conserved \r\nacross different cell types, explain the variability of the length of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac \r\nmarks,  which  implies  that  the  lengths  of  these  two \r\nepigenetic  marks  are  tightly regulated. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
