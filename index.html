<p>Recent epigenomic studies have shown that the length of a DNA region covered by an 
epigenetic mark is not just a byproduct of the assaying technologies and has functional 
implications for that locus. For example, expanded 
regions of DNA sequences that are 
marked by enhancer-specific histone modifications, 
such as acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) domains coincide with cell-specific enhancers, known as super or 
stretch enhancers. Similarly, promoters of genes critical for cell-specific functions are 
marked by expanded H3K4me3 domains in the cognate cell type, and these can span 
DNA regions from 4-5kb up to 40-50kb in length. These expanded H3K4me3 domains 
are known as buffer domains or super promoters. To ask what correlates with—and 
potentially regulates—the length of deposition patterns for these two important histone 
marks,  we  built  Random  Forest  regression  models and computationally  identified 
genomic and epigenomic patterns in multiple ENCODE cell lines and human pancreatic 
islets.  We  found  that  certain  epigenetic  marks  and 
transcription  factors,  conserved 
across different cell types, explain the variability of the length of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac 
marks,  which  implies  that  the  lengths  of  these  two 
epigenetic  marks  are  tightly regulated. </p>
